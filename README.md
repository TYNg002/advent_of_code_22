# advent_of_code_22
This repository contains the input files and solutions I used to solve problems in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Advent of Code include 25 days of problems, with 2 problems available for each day.

I've written my solutions in Python. 

## File namiing convention

Files are named as follows:
- First two digits indicate the year of Advent of Code
- Following two digits indicate the day from that year's Advent of Code
- Files labelled 'input' contain input for the problem
- Files labelled 'inputtest' contain example input for the problem, used for testing the solution
- Files labelled 'solution1' contain the solution to the first problem of the day
- Files labelled 'solution2' contain the solution to the second problem of the day
